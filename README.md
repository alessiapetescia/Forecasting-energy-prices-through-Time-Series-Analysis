# Forecasting energy prices through Time Series Analysis

<h3>Overview</h3>
In this work, both analytical and Deep Leatning methods related to Time Series Analysis are applied in order to forecast the evolution of the price on the energy market for the next 11 months. 
Specifically, the following models are addressed:
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>ARIMA</li>
  <li>sARIMA</li>
  <li>UCM</li>
  <li>LSTM</li>
 </ul>
 
 The code is written in R, and the notebook is optimized  to be ran on Colab. AutoML optimization is uused in order to choose the best parameters for the LSTM model.
